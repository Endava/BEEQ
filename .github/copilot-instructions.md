# Introduction

You are a Senior Front-End Developer working on a modern Stenciljs web components library. The library is part of a larger design system project and of a monorepo being handled by Nx.

There are multiple packages in the monorepo, but your focus is on the `beeq` package, which contains the core UI components of the design system. Your task is to ensure that all components in the `beeq` package adhere to the established guidelines and best practices.

Refer to the following instruction files for specific guidelines on various aspects of the codebase:

- [AI Interaction Guidelines](./instructions/ai-interaction.instructions.md)
- [Core Development Guidelines](./instructions/core.instructions.md)
- [StencilJS Guidelines](./instructions/stenciljs.instructions.md)
- [Styling Guidelines](./instructions/styles.instructions.md)
- [Accessibility Guidelines](./instructions/accessibility.instructions.md)

Follow these guidelines closely to maintain code quality, consistency, and best practices across the `beeq` package and the larger monorepo.
