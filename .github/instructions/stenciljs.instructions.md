# Components

All StencilJS components MUST ALWAYS FOLLOW this exact structure:

```typescript
@Component({
  tag: 'bq-<component-name>',
  styleUrl: 'bq-<component-name>.scss',
  shadow: true,
})
export class BqComponentName {
  // Own Properties
  // ====================

  // Reference to host HTML element
  // ===================================

  // State() variables
  // Inlined decorator, alphabetical order
  // =======================================

  // Public Property API
  // ========================

  // Prop lifecycle events
  // =======================

  // Events section
  // Requires JSDocs for public API documentation
  // ==============================================

  // Component lifecycle events
  // Ordered by their natural call order
  // =====================================

  // Listeners
  // ==============

  // Public methods API
  // These methods are exposed on the host element.
  // Always use two lines.
  // Public Methods must be async.
  // Requires JSDocs for public API documentation.
  // ===============================================

  // Local methods
  // Internal business logic.
  // These methods cannot be called from the host element.
  // =======================================================

  // render() function
  // Always the last one in the class.
  // ===================================

  render() {
    return <div>Component Content</div>;
  }
}
```

## Component Structure Rules

1. Section Order:
   - Own Properties: These are properties that are specific to the component, not related to the host element, and do not trigger re-renders.
   - Host Element References: These are references to the host HTML element, typically using the `@Element()` decorator.
   - State Variables (alphabetical): These are variables that manage the component's state, defined using the `@State()` decorator.
   - Public Properties: These are properties that can be set by the user of the component, defined using the `@Prop()` decorator.
   - Prop Lifecycle Events: These are lifecycle events related to the properties, such as `@Watch()` decorators.
   - Events (with JSDoc): These are custom events that the component can emit, defined using the `@Event()` decorator and documented with JSDoc.
   - Component Lifecycle Events (in call order): These are lifecycle methods that StencilJS provides, such as `connectedCallback()`, `disconnectedCallback()`, and `componentWillLoad()`.
   - Listeners: These are event listeners defined using the `@Listen()` decorator.
   - Public Methods (with JSDoc): These are methods that can be called by the user of the component, defined as public methods and documented with JSDoc.
   - Local Methods: These are internal private methods that are not exposed to the host element. They should be declared using arrow functions and with `private`, e.g., `private handleClick = () => {}`.
   - render() (always last): This is the render method that returns the component's HTML structure.

2. Naming Conventions:
   - Component tag: kebab-case with `bq-` prefix
   - Component class: PascalCase
   - State variables: camelCase
   - Properties and methods: camelCase
   - Events: camelCase prefixed with `bq` (e.g., `bqClick`)

3. Documentation:
   - All public APIs must have JSDoc documentation
   - Events must include detailed type information
   - Public methods must document parameters and return types

4. Method Rules:
   - Public methods must be async
   - Local methods should be private and use arrow functions

## Component Implementation

- Always use the @Element() decorator to access the component's DOM element
- Use the @Listen() decorator for event handling
- Implement proper lazy loading strategies
- Use proper slot patterns
- Follow proper event handling patterns
- Use proper component composition patterns
- Follow proper shadow DOM encapsulation patterns
- Implement proper form association
- Use proper custom element registry patterns

## Component State Management

- Use proper state management patterns
- Follow proper prop management
- Implement proper event handling
- Use proper lifecycle hooks
- Follow proper update patterns

## Component Performance

- Implement proper lazy loading
- Use proper code splitting
- Follow proper bundle optimization
- Implement proper resource loading
- Use proper rendering optimization

## Component Documentation

- Document component usage
- Provide proper examples
- Include proper API documentation
- Document proper integration patterns
- Include proper migration guides
