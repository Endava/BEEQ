## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before Starting ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Structure üß©

The project has been structured as an [NX monorepo](https://nx.dev) :

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ packages
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ beeq
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ beeq-angular
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ beeq-react
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ beeq-vue
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ tools
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
```

where:

- **[packages/beeq](./packages/beeq/):** Core library (source for all the elements/components implemented)
- **[packages/beeq-angular](./packages/beeq-angular):** Angular-specific wrapper for BEEQ core library
- **[packages/beeq-react](./packages/beeq-react):** React.js-specific wrapper for BEEQ core library
- **[packages/beeq-vue](./packages/beeq-vue):** Vue.js-specific wrapper for BEEQ core library

### Dependencies üì°

We recommend the use of [Volta](https://volta.sh/) to manage Node and NPM versions. The [installation process](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started) is pretty straightforward, and as referenced on their official site:

> With Volta, you can select a Node engine once and then stop worrying about it. You can switch between projects and stop having to manually switch between Nodes.

Once you have Volta installed, whenever you change to the BEEQ folder locally, it will switch to the right Node and NPM versions pinned in the `package.json`:

```json
  "volta": {
    "node": "20.9.0",
    "npm": "10.2.1"
  }
```

Volta is not mandatory, you can still use any Node/NPM setup that fits you most, just keep in mind that you'll need:

- [`NodeJS`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v16.x or higher
- [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/npm/what-is-npm/) v8 or higher

## Usage

The BEEQ components are published to the NPM package manager registry. You can use the `@bee-q/core` or any of the framework-specific wrappers (`@bee-q/angular`, `@bee-q/react`) depending on the technology stack of your project. Make sure the follow the usage instructions for each package:

- üìò [How to use the `@bee-q/core` package](packages/beeq/README.md)
- üìó [How to use the `@bee-q/angular` package](packages/beeq-angular/README.md)
- üìï [How to use the `@bee-q/react` package](packages/beeq-react/README.md)

> _More [output targets](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview) integration will be added later (e.g. Vue, Svelte)_

Feel free to [check our Storybook](https://storybook.bee-q.design/) to see all the BEEQ components released. There you can find all the component's APIs (properties, events, and methods exposed) along with the variations that each component allows.

## Running the project üèÉ‚Äç

To develop/extend components on the BEEQ Design System, please fork this repo in GitHub and clone it locally to a new directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/BEEQ.git BEEQ-Design-System
git checkout develop
cd BEEQ-Design-System
```

### Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

Simply run:

```bash
npm ci
# Make sure to build first the project before starting it
npm run build
npm start
```

Start coding üòÉ!

### Build üì¶

For a Production build, just run:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Test üß™

BEEQ uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit tests and Jest and [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) for end-to-end tests.

You can run all the tests once, by executing:

```bash
npm run test
```

üö® If you get an error similar to the one below, **try to check out locally the `main` branch and run the tests again**.

```bash
fatal: Not a valid object name main
fatal: No such ref: 'main'
nx affected
```

### Generate component

BEEQ comes with a component generator that saves you time when creating the skeleton for a new component. To use the generator, you just need to run the following command and follow the instructions in your prompt CLI:

```bash
npm run g
```
