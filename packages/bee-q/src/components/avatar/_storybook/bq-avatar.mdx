# Avatar

An avatar represents an object made of different pieces of information, in a way that is understandable at a glance.

## Usage

Avatars are never used alone. They are always used inside other components or patterns, where they represent a complex object, like a person or a stadium, in a very reduced space.

If the content - the person's or the the stadium's picture - is not available, then they must give a hint about what kind of image should be there.

## üëç When to use

Use an avatar to consistently represent a person, group, or project where the visual or semantic relationship provides context to the content it's in proximity to.
