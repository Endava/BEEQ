# Avatar

The Avatar component is a simple and customizable element that displays an image or initials in a circular or square shape.
This component is useful for displaying user profile pictures or any other image that represents a person or an entity.

## Usage

Here are some best practices to ensure a positive user experience with the Avatar component:

- **Make it identifiable:** The avatar should be easily recognizable and should represent the user or entity accurately. It should be appropriate and relevant to the context in which it is used.
- **Keep it simple:** The size and complexity of the avatar should be appropriate to the context in which it is used. A simple, clear design is usually better than a complex one that can be difficult to understand.
- **Ensure consistency:** Use the same avatar across all instances of the user or entity to ensure consistency and familiarity.
- **Provide alternative text:** Always provide alternative text for the avatar for users who cannot see the image. This can be achieved by using the `alt` attribute.

## üëç When to use

The Avatar component is commonly used in the following scenarios:

- **Profile pictures:** The Avatar is commonly used to display a user's profile picture.
- **Comment sections:** The Avatar is also commonly used in comment sections to display the picture of the user who made the comment.
