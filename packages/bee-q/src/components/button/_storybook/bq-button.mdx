# Button

Buttons are a crucial element of user interface design.
They allow users to interact with the system and perform actions such as submitting a form, navigating to a new page, or confirming a selection.

## Usage

When using buttons in your user interface design, it's important to follow some best practices to ensure they are effective and user-friendly. Here are some guidelines to keep in mind:

- Use buttons sparingly to avoid cluttering the interface.
- Use contrasting colors for the button and text to make them stand out.
- Use appropriate button types, such as primary, secondary, and tertiary, to indicate the importance of the action.
- Use icons in addition to text to convey the action of the button.

## üëç When to use

Buttons should be used for actions that are important for the user to perform, such as submitting a form, navigating to a new page, or confirming a selection.
**They should not be used for actions that can be performed through other means, such as clicking on a link.**
