<Title>Option</Title>

An option refers to a specific choice that appears in a list of selectable items that can be opened or closed by the user.
It can be an element of the navigation system that allows users to select different sections or pages within an application or it can be used within a dropdown list.
Each option within a dropdown list typically consists of a label and a value.

Some of the use cases where they can be used:

- Navigation
- Filtering and sorting
- Configuring settings
- Selecting from a large list of options
