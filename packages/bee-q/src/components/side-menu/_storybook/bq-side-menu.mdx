Menus are commonly used in user interfaces to provide a hierarchical navigation structure, providing users with a clear and intuitive way to navigate and interact with their application.
The Side Menu Component typically consists of a list of links or icons that allow users to access various sections, pages, or functionalities of an application. It remains collapsed by default and can be triggered to expand or slide in by clicking the footer button.

It can be used as the main navigation for the application or as a secondary navigation for specific sections of the application.
