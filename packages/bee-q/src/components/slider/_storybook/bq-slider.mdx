# Slider

The Slider component is a UI element that allows users to select a value from a range of values by sliding a thumb along a track.
It is a widely used component in user interfaces and is commonly used to adjust settings, input numerical values, or filter content.

## Usage

- Use a Slider when there is a need to adjust values within a specific range. Sliders are a great choice when you want users to be able to adjust something, but within a predetermined range.
- Use a Slider when the range of values is continuous. Sliders are best suited for continuous data ranges, rather than discrete values.
