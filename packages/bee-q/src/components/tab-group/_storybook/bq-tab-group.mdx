# Tabs or Tab group

The Tabs component is a user interface (UI) element that you can use to display content in multiple sections, allowing only one section to be visible at a time.
Tabs are typically placed in a horizontal bar that displays clickable buttons with labels for each section.
Tabs provide a clean and organized display of content, making it easier for users to navigate and understand the information presented.

## Usage

- Use a clear and consistent visual hierarchy to indicate which sections are most important or relevant to the user.
- Consider using icons or images in addition to text labels to make the purpose of each section more clear and visually appealing.
- Ensure that the tab bar is visible and easily accessible at all times, even when the user scrolls through the page or interface.
- Consider providing a default tab selection to avoid confusion for users who may not know which section to select first.
- Avoid using too many colors or visual effects, as this can distract from the content and make the interface appear cluttered or overwhelming.
- Consider using animations or transitions to provide visual feedback when the user selects a new tab or section.
- Test the Tabs component with real users to ensure that it is intuitive and meets their needs and expectations.

## üëç When to use

- Use the Tabs component when you have a large amount of content that can be divided into distinct, related sections.
- Use the Tabs component when you want to simplify the navigation of a complex interface, by dividing it into smaller, more manageable sections.
