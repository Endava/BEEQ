    The Avatar component is a simple and customizable element that displays an image or initials in a circular or square shape.
    This component is useful for displaying user profile pictures or any other image that represents a person or an entity.

    <Subtitle>Usage</Subtitle>

    Here are some best practices to ensure a positive user experience with the Avatar component:

    - **Make it identifiable:** The avatar should be easily recognizable and should represent the user or entity accurately. It should be appropriate and relevant to the context in which it is used.
    - **Keep it simple:** The size and complexity of the avatar should be appropriate to the context in which it is used. A simple, clear design is usually better than a complex one that can be difficult to understand.
    - **Ensure consistency:** Use the same avatar across all instances of the user or entity to ensure consistency and familiarity.
    - **Provide alternative text:** Always provide alternative text for the avatar for users who cannot see the image. This can be achieved by using the `alt` attribute.
