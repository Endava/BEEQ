    Buttons are a crucial element of user interface design.
    They allow users to interact with the system and perform actions such as submitting a form, navigating to a new page, or confirming a selection.

    When using buttons in your user interface design, it's important to follow some best practices to ensure they are effective and user-friendly. Here are some guidelines to keep in mind:

    - Use buttons sparingly to avoid cluttering the interface.
    - Use contrasting colors for the button and text to make them stand out.
    - Use appropriate button types, such as primary, secondary, and tertiary, to indicate the importance of the action.
    - Use icons in addition to text to convey the action of the button.
