    <Title>Dropdown</Title>

    The Dropdown Component is commonly used when presenting a list of selectable options that are too numerous to fit comfortably on the screen. They provide an efficient way to save space and present a long list of options in a compact and organized manner.
    Dropdowns are commonly used in navigation menus, forms, and other interactive elements where users need to select from a list of options.

    Do's

    - Use clear and concise language for the options in the dropdown, so that users can easily understand the context and meaning of the content.
    - Use visually distinct styles and colors for the options in the dropdown, so that users can easily see and understand the type and importance of the content.
    - Ensure that the dropdown component is responsive and easy to use, with a smooth and intuitive interaction that is accessible to users with different abilities and needs.
    - Provide clear and concise instructions or actions for users to select options or close the dropdown, so that they can complete their task or interaction.

    Don'ts

    - Use dropdowns for options that are not important or relevant, as this can lead to confusion or frustration for users.
    - Use dropdowns in a way that is misleading or inaccurate, as this can erode trust and credibility with users.
    - Use dropdowns in a way that makes it difficult for users to see or understand the options, such as by using small or unclear text or by displaying too many options at once.
