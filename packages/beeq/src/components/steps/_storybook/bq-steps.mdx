    The Steps Component is a UI element used to display a series of steps or stages in a process or task. Steps are commonly used in wizards, onboarding flows, or multi-step forms, and are a way to help users understand the progression of a task or process and their current status.
    It typically consists of a visually appealing representation of the current step, along with optional labels, icons, or additional information associated with each step.

    <Subtitle>üëç When to use</Subtitle>

    1. Multi-step processes: Use stepper items when there is a need to guide users through a multi-step process, such as signing up, completing a form, or placing an order.
    2. Wizard-like interfaces: Stepper items work well for implementing wizard-like interfaces where users need to progress through a series of steps to complete a task.
    3. Progress tracking: Stepper items can be used to visually track the progress of a user's actions, such as completing a tutorial or a course with multiple lessons.
