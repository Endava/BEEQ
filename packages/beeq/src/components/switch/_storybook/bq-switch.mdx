    The Switch component is a UI element that provides a switch-like interface to toggle a specific setting or option.
    It consists of a button or a switch that can be turned on or off, depending on the user's preference.

    - Use clear and descriptive labels that accurately describe the function of the Switch component.
    - Always provide visual feedback when the Switch component is switched on or off.
