    The Switch component is a UI element that provides a switch-like interface to toggle a specific setting or option.
    It consists of a button or a switch that can be turned on or off, depending on the user's preference.

    Here are some best practices to follow when using the Switch component:

    - Use the Switch component when you want to allow users to turn a setting or option on or off quickly and easily.
    - Use clear and descriptive labels that accurately describe the function of the Switch component.
    - Always provide visual feedback when the Switch component is switched on or off.
    - Use Switch components only for simple on/off settings. If you have more complex settings, use a different interface element such as a checkbox or dropdown menu.
